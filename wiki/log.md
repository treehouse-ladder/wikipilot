# Log

Chronological, append-only record of every routine run. Parseable with `grep "^## \[" wiki/log.md`.

Format (every entry uses this exact prefix):

```
## [YYYY-MM-DD] kind | subject

One-line summary.
```

Where `kind` is one of: `daily`, `query`, `health`, `manual`.

This file is **LLM-write, human-read**. Do not hand-edit; routines maintain it.
